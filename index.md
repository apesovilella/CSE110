### Math & CSE student

## **About Me**

Hi there! I am **Antonio**, a 4th year Mathematics student from Barcelona, Spain. I am 27 years old and I enjoy traveling and playing sports and Martial Arts in my free time. My favourite sports and martial arts are:

- Boxing
- Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- Lifting weights
- Hiking

I consider myself an open-minded and caring individual, always looking to improve myself through personal and professional challenges that life may present.

As my grandmother says:

<br/>

> *Mal no facis, mal no prenguis!*

<br/>

Or in English:

<br/>

> *Don't hurt, don't get hurt!*

<br/>

It's sort of a *motto* or guideline I follow in life. Facing adversity with a kind and respectful mindset is my way of life (or at least I think it is).

<br/>

### **Language**

Another important part of my life is **language**. I'm from a region in Spain called *Catalunya* or [**Catalonia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia) in English. Back home, I was raised speaking two different languages simultaneously: **Catalan** & **Spanish**.

<br/>

This bilingual upbringing shaped my interest in other languages and sparked my curiosity for **other cultures**. Growing up in a region where people use two languages to communicate with family and friends made me interested in seeing how others experience these differences (*or not* in cases where there are no conflicts about it at all).

So **traveling** became one of my main hobbies. So far, I've been able to see many places (mostly in Europe) and I'm looking forward to discovering more about our fantastic world.

## **Me as a Programmer**

I first got introduced to Programming while studying my first Bachelors in **Industrial Engineering** in Barcelona.

We had to work using **Python** and I quickly got the hang of it. With time, I realized that I enjoyed Programming and solving problems that were almost impossible without the help of computers.

After learning the basics, I decided to take some electives related to programming and could work on small projects such as:

1. Building and programming a Simon Says portable game (2016)
2. Developing a small videogame (2017)
3. Creating a phone app (2018)

After graduating and working for some months as an intern, I felt that my knowledge was somewhat lacking. I had studied different branches of Physics and some basic Mathematics, but I wanted to know more.

So in 2019 I decided to start a new Bachelors in Mathematics and I couldn't be more right about my decision. I enjoy almost every level of Mathematics and, most of all, I like Programming to solve Mathematical problems and think of optimal and elegant solutions to these problems.

During this Bachelors I learned how to program in **C** & **C++**, focusing on the mathematical thinking and not some much on the technical parts of a computer and the tools used to actually solve problems.

A nice and interesting problem is the study of [**Graphs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Examples). Their study is used in several areas of *Computer Science* such as the representation of **networks** of communication, **travel routes** and computer **chip design**.

In my opinion, the beauty of Programming is that one normally starts with the classic `Hello World!`:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

and can rather easily go to solve problems like the [**Travelling Salesman Problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) with just a set of basic structures like `vectors`.

## **Present Me**

Moving forward, I decided to put some time and effort into understanding these *black boxes* that we call computers.

That brought me to travel to the US and study at the **University of California in San Diego** and finally shine some light on this mystery.

My journey is still long and filled with hardships, but I feel I am moving in the right direction to reach expertise in CSE.
